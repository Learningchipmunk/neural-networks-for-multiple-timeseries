# Results Folder
Here we store the results of our experiments. On git, you will only find graphs related to the performance of our best model resulting from the experiment (`*.png` files). Also, you will find the training parameters used for the experiment in `Training_params.txt`. 

Note that the network parameters are stored in the `Configs` directory.
